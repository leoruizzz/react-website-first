            <h1> ABOUT US </h1>
            <p> Welcome to Leo Pizzas, where tradition meets innovation.
                Founded in 2010 by Leonardo Garc√≠a, a passionate chef with Italian roots, Leo Pizzas has become a reference point in the city for lovers of authentic pizza. Our founder, Leonardo, grew up in a family where pizza was more than a meal: it was a celebration of culture and family togetherness. Inspired by his grandmother's culinary secrets and his own creative spirit, Leonardo decided to share his love of pizza with the world.
                At Leo Pizzas, each pizza is a work of art. We use only the freshest, highest quality ingredients, many of which are imported directly from small farms in Italy. Our menu combines traditional recipes with modern touches, offering a unique experience to each customer. From the classic Margherita to original creations like the Honey Fig Prosciutto Pizza, there's something for everyone on our menu.
                But Leo Pizzas isn't just about the food; It's about the experience.
